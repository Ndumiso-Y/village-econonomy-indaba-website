          About the Village Economy Indaba
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4">
          The Village Economy Indaba is a comprehensive 12-month programme designed to promote sustainable
          economic growth within tribal communities. Our mission is to enhance local economies, improve
          livelihoods, and align our efforts with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4">
          Through this initiative, we aim to establish strong corporate governance and development frameworks
          that empower tribal communities. The programme also strategically positions these communities to
          access international funding opportunities, ensuring they have the resources needed to thrive.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-10">
          We believe in a future where every village is a hub of innovation, productivity, and prosperity â€”
          driven by its people, culture, and resilience.
        </p>
